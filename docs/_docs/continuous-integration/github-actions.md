When building a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages, Jekyll runs in an environment restricted for security
reasons, yet containing numerous [whitelisted plugins and themes][ghp-whitelist] to make it simpler
to get a site set up.

The only workaround to have control over the build environment and gemset yet use GitHub Pages to
host the site was previously by building elsewhere and pushing the built directory contents to the
`gh-pages` branch on your repository.

However, GitHub now provides you with the option to use their in-house CI/CD product named
*GitHub Actions* to *build and deploy (host)* your Jekyll site with complete control over the build
environment and gemset.

## Advantages of using Actions

### Control over gemset

- **Jekyll version** --- Instead of using the classic GitHub Pages-provided version specified in
  the [Dependency versions][ghp-whitelist] list, you can use any version of Jekyll you want.
  For example `{{ site.version }}`, or point directly to the repository via the Gemfile.
- **Plugins** --- You can use any Jekyll plugins irrespective of them being whitelisted by GitHub,
  including any `*.rb` files placed in the `_plugins` directory of your site.
- **Themes** --- While using a custom theme is possible without Actions, it is now possible to use
  themes depending on features introduced in newer versions of Jekyll.

{: .note .info}
If you are migrating from the classic flow but want to keep using a GitHub-hosted theme, you may use
the [jekyll-remote-theme][remote-theme] plugin, add any required dependencies of your theme
(previously bundled by default) into your `_config.yml` and `Gemfile` and set the
`remote_theme: <owner>/<repo_name>` theme repository slug correctly in your `_config.yml`.

### Workflow Management

- **Customization** --- By creating a workflow file to run Actions, you can specify custom build
  steps, use environment variables.
- **Logging** --- The build log is visible and can be tweaked to be verbose, so it is much easier to
  debug errors using Actions.
- **Caching** --- The `ruby/setup-ruby` action makes it possible to cache installed gems
  automatically instead of having to download the bundle on each build.

## Workspace setup

The first and foremost requirement is a Jekyll project hosted at GitHub. Choose an existing Jekyll
project or follow the [quickstart]({{ '/docs/' | relative_url }}) and push the repository to GitHub
if it is not hosted there already.

The Jekyll site we'll be using for the rest of this page, initially consists of just a `_config.yml`,
an `index.md` page and a `Gemfile`. The contents are respectively:

```yaml
# _config.yml

title: "Jekyll Actions Demo"
```

{% raw %}

```liquid
---
---

Welcome to My Home Page

{% assign date = '2020-04-13T10:20:00Z' %}

- Original date - {{ date }}
- With timeago filter - {{ date | timeago }}
```

{% endraw %}

```ruby
# Gemfile

source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem "jekyll", "~> 4.2"

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-timeago", "~> 0.13.1"
end
```

{: .note .info}
The demo site uses Jekyll 4 and a [third-party plugin][timeago-plugin], both of which are currently
not whitelisted for use on GitHub pages. The plugin will allow us to describe how far back a date
was from today. e.g. If we give a date as `2016-03-23T10:20:00Z` and the current date is
`2020-04-13T10:20:00Z`, then the output would be `4 years and 3 weeks ago`.

{: .note .info}
The action we're using takes care of installing the Ruby gems and dependencies. While that keeps
the setup simple for the user, one may encounter issues if they also check-in `Gemfile.lock` if it
was generated with an old version of Bundler.

### Setting up the Action

1. Go to the **Settings** tab on your repository.
    1. Click **Pages** under **Code and automation**.
    2. Change **Source** under **Build and deployment** from **Deploy from a branch** to **GitHub Actions**.
2. Go to the **Actions** tab on your repository.
    1. Start a **New workflow** and search for **Jekyll**.
    2. Click **Configure** under the **Jekyll** workflow (not **GitHub Pages Jekyll** workflow).
    3. Review the change and click **Commit changes**.

### Build and deploy

On pushing any local changes onto the default branch, the action will be triggered and the build will
**start**.

To watch the progress and see any build errors, check on the build **status** using one of the
following approaches:

- **View by commit**
  - Go to the repository level view in GitHub. Under the most recent commit (near the top) youâ€™ll
    see a **status symbol** next to the commit message as a tick or _X_. Hover over it and click
    the **details** link.
- **Actions tab**
  - Go to the repository's Actions tab. Click on the `jekyll` workflow tab.

If all goes well, all steps will be green and the built assets will be uploaded to GitHub Pages. 

To see the **live site**, go to the **Deployments** tab on your repository, and click on the deployed
site URL.

When you need to make further **changes** to the site, commit to the default branch and push.
The workflow will build and deploy your site again.
